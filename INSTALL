These are the installation instructions for the GPILog
Please be sure to see the file README for general information before
proceeding!


PREREQUISITES
You will need the following installed and working on your system before
proceeding:

GPIO Driver
If you are using one of the cards from MeasurementComputing, you
will need to install the GPIO driver.  Available at:

     ftp://ftp.salemradiolabs.com/pub/srlabs/gpio/

RPMs for SuSE are also available at:

     ftp://ftp.salemradiolabs.com/pub/srlabs/gpio/suse


INSTALLATION
Once the prerequisites are set up, installation is simply a matter of 
typing './configure', followed by 'make' and (as root) by 
'make install' in the top level directory.  

A configuration file, '/etc/gpilog.conf' needs to be created before
starting the gpilog(8) daemon.  The file 'gpilog.conf.example' in the top
of the source tree should provide some sane defaults.

Good Luck!
